# Spotify_Clone_CSS_Major_Project
This repository contains a Spotify clone built using HTML and CSS, created as part of a major CSS project. The goal is to replicate Spotify's web interface with a focus on layout, styling, and responsiveness using pure CSS.
Key Features:
1.Dark Theme: The entire page is styled with a sleek, dark color scheme, utilizing black and shades of gray for the background, and white for the text, to closely mimic Spotify's modern interface.

2.Responsive Layout: The design is fully responsive, with elements like the sidebar and main content area adapting to different screen sizes using flexbox and media queries.

3.Fixed Sidebar and Music Player: The sidebar is fixed on the left side, allowing easy navigation throughout the app. The music player is fixed at the bottom, with playback controls that mimic Spotify's functionality.

4.Custom Scroll and Hover Effects: The project features custom scrollbar styling, as well as smooth hover effects for interactive elements like buttons, icons, and cards.

5.Album and Playlist Cards: The main content area includes a grid of album and playlist cards, each styled with CSS to have rounded corners, hover effects, and a layout that adjusts based on the viewport.

Styles:
1.Font: The project uses the "Montserrat" font for a clean and modern look.
2.Layout: Flexbox is used extensively to create a flexible and responsive layout. The main content area adjusts its width based on the sidebar, and elements are aligned and spaced using flex properties.
3.Color Scheme: The color scheme is consistent, with a dark background (#000 and #121212) and white text (#fff). Accent colors are used for hover effects and interactive elements.
4.Interactive Elements: Icons and buttons have opacity changes on hover to provide visual feedback, with transitions for smooth animations.

Purpose:
This project serves as a demonstration of CSS skills, particularly in creating complex layouts, managing responsiveness, and applying advanced styling techniques to create a visually appealing and functional web page.
